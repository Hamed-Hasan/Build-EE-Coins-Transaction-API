# Build Empowering Energy Task Coins Transaction API

## Overview
Welcome to the Tasks & Coins Phase project. This initiative is designed to streamline task management and incentivization using a coin-based system. Our backend is robustly developed within a focused 1-week sprint, while the frontend receives an equally vigorous 2-week phase to ensure a seamless user experience.
